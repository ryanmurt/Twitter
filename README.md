# Abstract
Since 2006, Twitter’s APIs have provided treasure troves of high-quality data for researchers examining a wide range of social phenomena, from the diffusion of misinformation, to patterns in public communication, crisis response, and political behavior. However, in 2023, Twitter began heavily restricting access to their data, dismantling their academic access program, and changing the price tag for API access to $42,000/month for its Enterprise level–an essential death knell for researcher use. Lacking funds to pay this fee, academics are scrambling to continue their research. This study systematically tabulates the number of studies, citations, publication dates, disciplines, and major topics of study using Twitter data between 2006 and 2024. While we cannot know for certain what will be lost now that Twitter data is cost prohibitive, we can illustrate its research value during the time it was available. A search of eight databases found that between 2006-2024, a total of 33,306 studies were published in 8,914 venues, with 623,212 citations, across 16 disciplines. Major disciplines include: social science, engineering, data science, and public health. Major topics include: information dissemination, tweets credibility, research methodologies, event detection, and human behavior. Twitter studies have increased by a median of 25% every year since 2006, but following Twitter’s decision to charge for data, the number of studies has decreased by 13%. We assume that much of the data for studies in 2024 was collected prior to Twitter’s API shutdown, thus the number of studies is likely to decline further in future years. This trend highlights a growing loss of empirical insight and access to real-time, public communication, raising concerns about the long-term consequences for studying society, technology, and global events in an era increasingly connected by social media.
